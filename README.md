# CCES
This project provides an analysis of the effect of partisan and ideological cues on support for marijuana legalization using data from the 2014 CCES. A survey experiment was ran where respondents were asked to rate their support for marijuana legalization after being given cues. Respondents were asked to what extent they agree with the following statement: 

“Recreational marijuana should be legal for adults.” 

Responses options ranged from “Strongly Disagree” (1) to “Strongly Agree” (7), with “Neither Agree Nor Disagree” (4) in the middle. 

The text preceding this question was varied in the following way across experimental conditions:
  “Society” prime, randomly assigned to 1/3rd of respondents:
    Some individual choices may harm society. Studies say that marijuana
    abuse makes individuals unproductive and causes health problems that
    may require costly care that society often pays for. So, many people
    believe that recreational marijuana must remain illegal to prevent people
    from making choices that are costly for society.
    
  “Paternalistic” prime, randomly assigned to 1/3rd of respondents:
    Some individual choices may harm those who make them. Studies say that
    marijuana abuse makes individuals unproductive and causes health
    problems that may require costly care. So, many people believe that
    recreational marijuana must remain illegal to prevent people from making
    choices that are costly for them.
    
  “Control” no prime, randomly assigned to 1/3rd of respondents
    In the Society prime, we frame a ban on marijuana as designed to protect society from 
    bad individual decisions. Under the Paternalistic prime, we frame current marijuana policy as 
    designed to protect individuals from their own bad decisions.
    
In the elite cute study, respondents were asked the same question as before, but the introductory text in this case was as follows:

"Recreational marijuana has been illegal in the United States for many
years. Recently, some have argued that recreational marijuana should be
legal for adults and regulated like alcohol."

Responses once again ranged from “Strongly Disagree” (1) to “Strongly Agree” (7), with “Neither Agree Nor Disagree” (4) in the middle. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of five experimental conditions. The conditions added the following text at the end of the introductory portion of the question prompt above:

“Dem Negative” prime, randomly assigned to 1/5th of respondents:
  …Senior Democratic leaders in Congress say that marijuana should remain illegal.
  
“Rep Negative” prime, randomly assigned to 1/5th of respondents:
  …Senior Republican leaders in Congress say that marijuana should remain illegal.
  
“Dem Positive” prime, randomly assigned to 1/5th of respondents:
  …Senior Democratic leaders in Congress say that marijuana should be legalized.
  
“Rep Positive” prime, randomly assigned to 1/5th of respondents:
  …Senior Republican leaders in Congress say that marijuana should be legalized.
  
“Control” prime, randomly assigned to 1/5th of respondents:
  No text added.
